#  apparently cobbler can be "slow" and thus be greatly improved by caching the data
#  when caching is used the cache_path dir variable will have 2 files within:
#    - ansible-cobbler.cache
#    - ansible-cobbler.index

cache_path = path_to_cache_variables
cache_path = /tmp/ansible_cobbler_cache

# the cache has to be update, setting the following (in seconds) will trigger a refresch call
# to cobblers api

cache_max_age = integer
cache_max_age = 900     # seconds

# question: can dynamic inventory scripts be set to update cache on upstream changes?

using the script
Initial use is to run... assuming cobbler has stuff already there.

/etc/ansible/cobbler.py

There is some automated setup.  What is retruned from cobbler becomes your inventory, so
ansible defined variables that collide with the cobbler variables are overwritten by the
cobbler values.

# ansible setup module is run at playbook time, to just run a setup without a playbook
# the following commands will achive this:
ansible webserver -m setup
ansible webserver -m template -a "src=/tmp/motd.j2 dest=/etc/motd"
